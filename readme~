Fast implementation of GBM

Goal:
1) Simple (The less lines of code, the better) 
2) Fast (Handle 40M * 500 features within 12 hours)

Algorithms:
1) pre-bucketing
2) bucket sort to scan for the best splitting point
3) ...... (trim features)

new features:
1) byte/short: two layer of storage.
`

Prameters:
m: number trees
n: number of leaves per tree
r: example sampling rate
s: 

Complexity:
O(

Components:
Reader

DataSet (column-wise storage, for both double and short)
Bucketizer (convert
